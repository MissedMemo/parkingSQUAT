##Building & Running:

(at command line): navigate to the implementation directory and type react-native run-ios

(in Finder): navigate to the 'ios' sub-directory in your source code files, and run the file with the .xcodeproj extension.

##Implementation Notes:

File structure set up for IOS & Android acc. to recc'd best practices (genericized content in files index.ios.js and index.android.js at project root reference a shared 'main.js' file in the /src directory  ), but using elements that are IOS-specific, due to time constraints.
